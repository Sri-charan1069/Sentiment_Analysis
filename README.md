# Sentiment Analysis Project Using NLP and SVM

This project involves conducting sentiment analysis on e-commerce reviews using NLP techniques and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. Text data was preprocessed, and features were extracted using vectorizers to convert text into numeric form. The NLTK library was used for text processing and feature extraction. The SVM model was trained and evaluated, achieving high accuracy in classifying sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.
